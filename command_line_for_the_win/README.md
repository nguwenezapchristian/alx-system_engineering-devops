# Command line for the win Challenge


#Description

This repo is for the command line challenge done in ALX,
and i also used secure file transfer SFTP to transfer screenshoots
which show the challenges i did.



#How i used SFTP to upload files on remote system:

- I cloned the repository on the remote system
- I created the dir called command line for the win
- then on my local machine, i opened the directory containing
the files i want to transfer in my terminal
- i used the SFTP command ```sftp sammy@your_server_ip_or_remote_hostname``` 
- In sftp prompt i used the command put with the filename to upload it on
the remote system
- after uploading all files one by one, i went back on my remote system which
is the sandbox and pushed all files on the github
